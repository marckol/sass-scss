Provide sass/scss style sheet utulities : parse, write, convert to css style sheet

## How and why this sass/scss utilities

January 2022, 7th, I saw examples of forms in internet. I found some very interseting and pleasant, I downloaded them. I was very insterested by a particular one that had scss stylesheet file only not css. I've try to convert it online but unsucessfully. The error was the follwing: **Error! Undefined mixin transition: failed at `@include transition(all 0.218s); ` line: 104**.

I've continued to find solution online and to troubleshoot. After a time, I decided to know more about sasss/scss and finally to write a converter.

Before that I've never work with scss.

I've converted the scss file the code I wrote. **It's a great pleasure for me to share my codes.** I hope it helps many persons.
